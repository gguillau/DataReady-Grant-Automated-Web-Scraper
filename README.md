# Grant Automation


### Overview
Researching grant prospects could be time-consuming and overwhelming. Our goal in this
project is to develop an automation system so that our organization is able to find available grant opportunities and fill out applications with little or no human intervention.

### Goals/Objectives

Main objectives are:

• Find suitable online grant opportunities

• Create autofill scripts to fill in constant values

• Make an user-friendly GUI with tracking information


### Procedures/Scope of Work
During the initial stage of the project, we mainly focus on web scraping in Python with
Selenium. After successfully extracting relevant grant information, we will filter/train our
script to select further grant opportunities using Natural Language Processing. Once the
selection process is completed, we will proceed to the Automation stage, where we use
Selenium to automate the login procedure and autofill forms. 

Our final goal is to make our
project accessible and intuitive. To achieve this, we can integrate our script into a Graphical
User Interface or dashboard, where users can interact with our scripts and make changes
where need be. If we are able to complete all the stages stated above, we can also incorporate
application progress tracking, where our clients will be notified should updates arise.
