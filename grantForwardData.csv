Past funding, although providing eligibility to apply, is no guarantee of future funding and organizations are asked to limit their request to $5,000 and under unless otherwise directed.

Our Board of Directors will re-visit the funding guidelines regularly, and when any changes are made, the website will be updated accordingly.

Grants will tend to be made to smaller organizations located in areas where our trustees reside which include but are not limited to the Sandhills area of North Carolina, South Carolina and the Greater Chicago-land area.",,http://www.clmff.com/grants_application.htm,0

- Not-for-profit hospitals
- Academic health centers
- Area health education centers
- Select organizations in counties without an eligible hospital
- Not-for-profit inpatient long-term care facilities

Why does the Endowment only support programs in North Carolina and South Carolina?
We exist to fulfill the legacy of North Carolina industrialist and philanthropist James B. Duke. All grantmaking at the Endowment is guided by an Indenture of Trust (pdf), in which James B. Duke set forth specific funding guidelines that focused on children, rural churches, health care and higher education in the Carolinas. While our trustees have full discretion over year-to-year disbursements, all grants must be made in accord with the wishes of Mr. Duke that they support lives and communities in North Carolina and South Carolina.

Select 501(c)(3) organizations in North Carolina and South Carolina may be eligible for grants

The following are ineligible for funding:
- Individuals
- Organizations without a presence in North Carolina or South Carolina
- Organizations with any legal status other than 501(c)(3)

Traditional Arts Touring Grants,"What are Traditional Arts?
The South is home to an abundance of traditional art forms whether they are indigenous to the region, or reflect the traditions of recent immigrant communities. Traditional arts are shared aesthetics, practices and values of families, geographic communities, occupational groups, ethnic heritage groups, etc. Traditional arts are learned orally, or by observation and imitation, often through a master artist instructing an apprentice. They are usually maintained without formal instruction or academic training. Some traditional arts have a deep-rooted history with little change, while others are constantly evolving and adapting to their changing environment.

Examples of traditional art forms (performing and visual arts) being practiced in the South include Afro-Cuban bata  drum, Catawba pottery, Zydeco music, Indian Bharatha Natyam dance, Anglo American quilting, Peruvian retablos, African American gospel music, Chinese zheng, Cherokee storytelling, and Minorcan netmaking, among others.

Program Goals
The Traditional Arts Touring Grant Program works to increase the public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the traditional arts in the South, through funding projects that bring a traditional artist/ensemble and a scholar/folklorist for multi-day residencies in Southern communities.

This funding program is open to a wide variety of organizations, including community cultural organizations, schools/colleges/universities, libraries, museums, presenters, etc. The program serves both communities and traditional artists. Priority consideration is given to support new applicants and underserved communities.

South Arts staff can also direct you to potential resources and networks to identify traditional artists and scholars/folklorists. Applicants are strongly advised to contact Teresa Hollingsworth (Director, Film and Traditional Arts), thollingsworth@southarts.org or 404-874-7244 x 14 to discuss your project before you submit your application.",,https://www.southarts.org/community-organization-grants/traditional-arts-touring-grants,0
Child & Family Well-Being Grant,"The Duke Endowment has introduced a new pre-application process for the Child and Family Well-Being program area. It consists of several questions, which will help confirm your eligibility and guide you to one of two areas of work, Prevention and Early Intervention for At-Risk Children and Out-of-Home Care.

Within Child and Family Well-Being, we focus our work in two main areas:

Prevention and Early Intervention for At-Risk Children
Programs that focus on replicating evidence-based programs, (such as Incredible Years, or Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and building North Carolina and South Carolina's capacity to implement evidence-based models.

Search our current Prevention and Early Intervention for At-Risk Children grantees.

Out-Of-Home Care
Programs that help the child welfare system improve well-being through better assessment and the exclusive use of high quality providers that offer a range of services during and after care.

Search our current Out-Of-Home Care grantees.

Funding Categories 
Our funding is divided into three broad categories.

Replicating success grants reflect the value we place on proven programs and effective practices. Proven programs are those with at least two randomized control trials with results demonstrating effectiveness that have been replicated in a real-world setting.

Effective practices are all other programs whose evidence of effectiveness consists of only one randomized control trial, comparison group data, pre- and post-test results or other types of data.

As we work to address persistent social problems, expand individual opportunity and provide essential support, we value established approaches with clear records of success and replicable models, including:

- Multisystemic Therapy (MST)
- Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)
- Positive Parenting Program (Triple-P)
- Strengthening Families
- The Incredible Years
- Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)
- Other proven approaches will be considered as well.

Strengthening organizations grants reflect our commitment to building the infrastructure of effective organizations and institutions. In our efforts to improve facilities, systems, management and operations, we are particularly interested in supporting opportunities that show great promise for long-term gains.

Advancing innovation grants reflect our investment in projects that advance innovation when high-achieving, successful models are lacking.",,https://dukeendowment.org/grants/apply-grant,0

With a shared belief that the bond between animals and humans can support mental health, improve healing, and enable independent living, the following areas follow the convictions of Edwin and Joan Nahikian.

Child welfare and short-term foster care

Development and placement of service and assistance dogs
The Nahikian Family Foundation has a commitment to help fund the training and development of therapy, service and search/rescue dogs.

Companion animal placement through no-kill animal shelters
The Nahikian Family Foundation seeks to enable organizations that have a proven track record of working with their local community to place adoptable animals with human companions. The foundation prefers to provide grants to these organizations for capital initiatives.

Medical support for children and their families
The Nahikian Family Foundation supports special funding for projects that provide direct medical care to communities with limited or no medical facilities. This can include funding disaster relief or establishment of medical care facilities that are located where community needs are greatest.

The alarming proliferation of synthetic drugs and opioids have had a crushing effect on many crime laboratories. Synthetic opioids in particular may be more difficult to analyze than traditional opiates, and validating methods for new drugs as they emerge may significantly slow processing of these samples. Medical examiners and forensic pathologists have also been overwhelmed with the volume of autopsies as a result of opioids and synthetic drug-related overdose deaths. To address these issues, states are to allocate approximately 64% of available funds to specifically target the challenges the opioid abuse crisis has brought to the forensic science community.  To this end, the OHSJP welcomes opioid and synthetic drugs-specific projects for FY 2020.",,https://scdps.sc.gov/sites/default/files/Documents/ohsjp/fsgf/Special%20Opioid%20Solicitation-2018%20Paul%20Coverdell%20Application%20Guidelines%20and%20Procedures.docx,0

Community Impact Grants - Open Granting,"Focus Areas
The needs and opportunities in Greenwood County are numerous, and local resources to meet these are plentiful.  Greenwood community members have consistently been generous in their support of local organizations and individuals in need.

But because the resources of the Greenwood County Community Foundation are not limitless, we have established Community Impact Grants in strategic Focus Areas. Focus Areas are designed to be broad enough to encompass a wide range of programs, projects, and people.  They are subject to reconsideration by the Foundation's Board and Staff as community concerns change and evolve.

Open Granting
This cycle will be open for any grant request meeting our granting guidelines, but particularly for programs and projects which do not fall within any of the above categories.

Any organization which has not received a grant from GCCF during this calendar year may apply in the Open Granting cycle. Requests which were submitted earlier in this calendar year but did not receive funding may be rolled into this cycle.",,https://www.greenwoodcf.org/grants/2020-timeline-and-applications/,0

"W. W. Burgiss Charities, Inc Grant","About the Foundation
William W. Burgiss (originally spelled Burgess; he changed his last name as a young man, perhaps to differentiate himself from the rest of his family) was born on a farm northwest of what became the village of Greer on August 12, 1863. By the time he was sixteen, he was working as a clerk in a local tin shop, but he was soon engaged in commercial enterprises, including buying and selling real estate in both Greer and Greenville.

In the early 1890s, Mr. Burgiss became interested in cotton mills. In 1894, he was one of a group of young men who chartered Victor Mill and, when it opened in 1895, he was named president. In 1900, he invested in and became president of Franklin Mill. Also, he was among the first peach growers in the Greer area.

Local leaders lured him to Greenville about 1905. By 1913, he had constructed the three-story Burgiss Building at the corner of North Richardson and West Coffee Streets, where he located his real estate office, on the site currently occupied by Bank of America. His real estate transactions, however, were not limited to Greenville. Even after he moved from Greer to Greenville, he continued to own substantial amounts of land both in the town of Greer and around the countryside. After 1911, he began to invest heavily in Florida real estate, especially in land in Jacksonville and West Palm Beach. Much of his increasing wealth derived from those profitable investments. By the 1920s, W. W. Burgiss was an exceptionally wealthy man. Like many of Greenvilles progressive business leaders during the prosperous early years of the decade, he turned his attention to charity and community service. 

On May 2, 1925, the Greenville News announced that W. W. Burgiss had established the countys first charitable foundation with approximately $1 million in assets, including stocks, bonds, and land in both Greer and Florida. Burgisss emphasis, as he made clear in his will, was to support the causes of religion, charities and education, with special attention to the assistance of the sick, helpless and needy and to the education of the underprivileged. 

The first major project of Burgiss Charities was covering the cost of land and construction ($300,000) of Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, which opened on Rutherford Road in 1927 and was the first integrated charitable orthopedic hospital in the South. The foundation also immediately committed $10,000 to help build a mountain camp for the YWCA, which led to the establishment of Camp Burgiss Glen.

In 1937, Mr. Burgiss moved to West Palm Beach, Florida and remained there until his death on February 8, 1945. The majority of his estate was left to Burgiss Charities.

Mission
To aid and promote the causes of religion, charities, and education in Greenville County, South Carolina with special attention to the assistance of the sick, helpless, needy, and to the education of the underprivileged.",,https://www.wellsfargo.com/private-foundations/burgiss-charities,0

Gambrill Foundation Grant,"About the Foundation

The Gambrill Foundation was created on November 18, 1966 by Anne J. Gambrill of Anderson County, South Carolina in honor of her parents and to address the charitable needs of the Anderson County, South Carolina area. Anne served as Co-Trustee of the Foundation until her death on December 27, 1991.

Anne J. Gambrill was an only child who was raised in a lovely home in Anderson. As a child, Anne suffered from the dreaded poliomyelitis polio which left her with restricted mobility. However, she did not allow her disability to keep her from thriving in life. She maintained a vibrant social life and pursued her interests. Anne was educated at Agnes Scott College, and she was involved in numerous community activities.

Anne was not disheartened by the progression of her disability, but she used her challenges to help others. For example, she built an enclosed heated swimming pool to help treat the arthritis that later developed from her polio illness. She used the pool personally, but she also allowed children to use it to help treat their pain and illnesses. Anne was not only a philanthropist, but a humanitarian as well.

Mission: To support a variety of charitable causes with a primary focus on organizations that uplift and positively impact the residents of the Anderson County, South Carolina area.",,https://www.wellsfargo.com/private-foundations/frequently-asked-questions,0

The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation - Research Libraries Program,"The Research Libraries Program concentrates primarily in those areas of its founders' interests and aims to be fully complementary to the Foundation's other program areas (i.e., humanities scholarship, performing arts, and Venetian history and culture).

The overall objective of the Research Libraries Program is to improve the ability of research libraries to serve the needs of scholarship in the humanities and the performing arts, and to help make their resources more widely accessible to scholars and the general public. Wherever possible, grants to libraries seek to promote cooperative cataloging projects, with an emphasis on access to archival, manuscript, and other unique sources; some elements of interpretation and exhibition; scholarly library publications; bibliographical and publishing projects of interest to research libraries; and collection-level preservation/conservation work and research.

Small-scale digitizing is eligible for support when the process is part of a clearly defined and timely scholarly project that incorporates recognized standards for metadata production, for preservation, and for distribution. The Foundation does not support massive digitizing projects of a general nature.

The geographical concentration is primarily but not exclusively directed toward European and American history and letters, broadly defined. Technological developments that support humanities research and access to humanities resources are also eligible. A limited number of modest grants will also be available for projects related to the history of the book, book culture, printing history, and related programs. Conferences designed to address these issues in collaborative ways and programs formulated to enhance or leverage similar activity by other institutions, consortia, or funding agencies will also be considered.",,http://delmas.org/grants/general-application-guidelines/,0

Elsie H. Hillman Foundation Grants,"Mission

The Elsie H. Hillman Foundation's mission is to improve the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania through strategic and thoughtful grantmaking in support of a wide range of institutions to advance community development, health, education, human services, the arts, and the environment - with a primary focus on investing in women, minorities, and civic leadership programs.

Overview

Elsie Hillman (1925-2015) epitomized the best of philanthropy in Pittsburgh for over 60 years. To everyone who had the pleasure of meeting her, she was simply ""Elsie,"" and she worked tirelessly to make Pittsburgh a better place, with particular attention to helping those who didn't have the knowledge, the access, or just that bit of encouragement needed to help themselves. She was a pioneer as a political leader who for over 60 years worked tirelessly to elect candidates from school board members to President of the United States, but her political work, civic activities, and philanthropic efforts were always intertwined. Elsie was always in it to make everything better for others in some way. The Elsie Hilliard Hillman Foundation was formed in 2006 with a gift from her husband, Henry L. Hillman, on the occasion of her 80th birthday, ""given with love forever."" Henry created the Foundation as a tribute to Elsie and to provide her with dedicated resources to pursue her own philanthropic agenda and to support the organizations and causes that mattered most to her. Although the Foundation has a wide range of interests, over the nine years for which Elsie served as its chair, she emphasized the need to support projects and organizations that help and promote women and minorities. These interests remain a focus for the Foundation today, as it continues its work as a testimony to the impact of Elsie's selfless commitment to the people of Pittsburgh.

Guiding Principles

The Elsie H. Hillman Foundation invests in the growth of young civic leaders and in building communities that improve quality of life for all citizens and particularly for women and minorities.

* To live up to its ""Most Livable"" title, Pittsburgh must continuously invest in the creation of opportunities for women and minorities. People of all different colors, genders, cultures, sexual orientations, backgrounds, and beliefs deserve to have a voice and to be fully engaged in shaping the future of the region.
* ""Don't be a spectator. You are needed in every corner of the community."" Elsie shared this observation with the writers of an Institute of Politics case study on her political life. She firmly believed that leadership, volunteerism, and active engagement in public life are needed in every neighborhood, especially among the region's young people.
* Neighbors should help each other, injecting a healthy dose of fun and joy along the way. Sometimes our neighbors just need a helping hand. Such needs can arise from a flood, fire, an act of violence, financial crisis, government funding cuts, or other unexpected life turmoil.",,http://hillmanfamilyfoundations.org/foundations/elsie-h-hillman-foundation/,1

Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation Grants,"Mission

The Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation's mission is to improve the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania through strategic and thoughtful grantmaking in support of a wide range of institutions to advance community development, health, education, human services, the arts, and the environment, with a primary focus on improving the lives and future outlook of disadvantaged populations.

Overview

Mary Hillman Jennings (1921-1979) was involved in a wide range of community activities in Pittsburgh and, with her sister, Patricia, was a dedicated advocate for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). She created the Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation in 1968 with the intention of advancing her charitable work and her support for Pittsburgh-area nonprofit organizations. Among the wide range of programs and projects it supports, the Foundation continues to honor Mary's generosity and legacy by providing grants to assist individuals with IDD as well as other behavioral challenges.

Guiding Principles

The Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation works to ensure that citizens of southwestern Pennsylvania, including those who are too often marginalized, receive high-quality, innovative services and have the resources and opportunities to benefit fully from the region's improving quality of life.

Mary Hillman Jennings believed that a truly world-class region invests in the lives of its most vulnerable citizens and in the improvement of its most disadvantaged communities.

Keith Haring generously contributed his talents and resources to numerous causes.  He conducted art workshops with children, created logos and posters for public service agencies, and produced murals, sculptures, and paintings to benefit health centers and underserved communities.   Haring established the Keith Haring Foundation to ensure that his philanthropic legacy would continue indefinitely.

Goals
The Keith Haring Foundation funds sustainable initiatives that meet its mandate, and that provide proof of need and exemplary performance.   The Foundation will not consider requests for funding that can otherwise be covered by federal, state, or city sources.

Areas of Focus
YOUTH:

The Keith Haring Foundation will consider funding requests concentrating on New York City's highest-risk youth and adolescents, with the aim of helping them to become self-sufficient adults. Programs that provide long-term support and mentoring to vulnerable youth are particularly invited to apply. Preference will be given to programs that are inadequately supported by public funds.

HIV/AIDS:

The Keith Haring Foundation will consider funding requests that assist New Yorkers infected with HIV or at high risk of becoming infected. Priority will be given to serving the populations most vulnerable to HIV-infection and its consequences. Preference will be given to programs inadequately supported by public funds.

ARTS & CULTURE:

The Keith Haring Foundation will consider funding requests from institutions that provide educational and cultural enrichment. Applicants should reflect upon the breadth of their programming and public outreach as it relates to Haring's legacy of social activism and cultural contribution, and to the historical context of his creative and philanthropic vision. Priority will be given to programs that address a critical need not covered by other funding sources.",,http://www.haring.com/kh_foundation/grants/grant-guidelines,0

Polk Foundation Grants,"Mission

The Polk Foundation's mission is to support high-quality programs that provide people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities with opportunities and choices to grow and function at their full potential as independently as possible.

Overview

In 1951, Patricia Hillman Miller (1923-1968), the youngest daughter of John Hartwell Hillman, Jr., was stricken with polio. She recovered but was confined to a wheelchair for the remainder of her life. This experience only strengthened her keen interest in assisting people with disabilities.

In 1957, Patricia created a foundation to provide support for the Polk School in Venango County - hence the foundation's name. Polk School (now Polk State Center) was a state-owned and operated facility for children with disabilities. At that time, it was the only available option for families in the region, and it had a long waiting list. After several years of effort, in 1961 Patricia was instrumental in the successful opening of the Allegheny Valley School for Exceptional Children - a new school dedicated to serving children with disabilities in southwestern Pennsylvania. Initially, the Polk Foundation's primary mission was to support the Allegheny Valley School. This close relationship has continued to the present, although the Polk Foundation now supports a broader set of organizations serving individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Guiding Principles

Every person with a disability deserves to live in dignity and to have maximum opportunity to grow, achieve, and succeed. Honoring Patricia Hillman Miller's commitment to this principle, the Foundation will continue to focus primarily on improving the quality of life for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.",,https://hillmanfamilyfoundations.org/grants/apply/,0

The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation - Humanities Program,"The Foundation intends to further the humanities along a broad front, supporting projects which address the concerns of the historical studia humanitatis: a humanistic education rooted in the great traditions of the past; the formation of human beings according to cultural, moral, and aesthetic ideals derived from that past; and the ongoing debate over how these ideals may best be conceived and realized.

Programs in the following areas are eligible: history; archaeology; literature; languages, both classical and modern; philosophy; ethics; comparative religion; the history, criticism, and theory of the arts; and those aspects of the social sciences which share the content and methods of humanistic disciplines. The Foundation welcomes projects that cross the boundaries between humanistic disciplines and explore the connection between the humanities and other areas of scholarship. Programs of institutions in Venice relating to the humanities are eligible in this category. (Individuals seeking research grants for work in Venice should see Venetian Programs.)  The geographical concentration is primarily but not exclusively directed toward European and American history and letters, broadly defined.

The Humanities Program is primarily directed to institutions of higher education and humanistic enterprises such as learned societies, museums, and major editorial projects. The program may also consider, on a selective basis, projects that increase the exposure of those outside these institutions to the humanistic experience or that strengthen preparation for the humanistic disciplines.  The prime criterion remains that of Gladys and Jean Delmas: a commitment to excellence, whether proven or promised.",,http://delmas.org/grants/general-application-guidelines/,1

Evidence for Action: Investigator-Initiated Research to Build a Culture of Health,"Purpose
Evidence for Action (E4A), a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), funds research that expands the evidence needed to build a Culture of Health. A Culture of Health is broadly defined as one in which good health and well-being flourish across geographic, demographic, and social sectors; public and private decision-making is guided by the goal of fostering equitable communities; and everyone has the opportunity to make choices that lead to healthy lifestyles. RWJF's Culture of Health Action Framework, which was developed to catalyze a national movement toward improved health, well-being, and equity, guides E4A's program strategy.

B ACK G RO U ND A ND P U RP O SE 

Evidence for Action (E4A), a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), funds research that expands the evidence needed to build a Culture of Health. A Culture of Health is broadly defined as one in which good health and well-being flourish across geographic, demographic, and social sectors; public and private decisionmaking is guided by the goal of fostering equitable communities; and everyone has the opportunity to make choices that lead to healthy lifestyles. RWJF's Culture of Health Action Framework, which was developed to catalyze a national movement toward improved health, well-being, and equity, guides E4A's program strategy. Visit rwjf.org/cultureofhealth to learn more about the Action Framework and RWJF's vision for building a Culture of Health.

E4A's mission is to support rigorously designed quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research that yields convincing findings about the population health, well-being, and equity impacts of specific policies, programs and practices. We primarily target research that directly tests the impacts of interventions on health outcomes. Evidence generated through 

E4A should be useful to practitioners and policymakers in making decisions, setting priorities, and allocating resources. Accordingly, projects we fund should yield findings that are generalizable to other sites and/or populations. We are especially interested in research examining the health impacts of program or policy interventions that address factors outside the domain of health care services or public health practice.

P RO GRA M FI T 
E4A is an investigator-initiated research funding program, and as such does not pose a specific set of research questions, topics, or categories for funding. This call for proposals (CFP) offers guidance and clarification about the types of projects that are likely to be a good fit with the program's general goals and objectives. Research examples highlighted in this CFP are intended to provide context and stimulate thinking, not serve as rigid guidelines or restrictions. Investigators are encouraged to submit innovative proposals using any appropriate combination of research designs and methods.

APP RO A CHE S AND OUTCO M E S 
E4A focuses on funding research that establishes evidence of causal relationships between an intervention and population health and well-being outcomes. Interventions are defined broadly to include programs, policies, and practices; and we consider health and well-being to be represented by a wide range of physical, mental, and emotional measures. Except in specific instances described later in this CFP, studies funded by E4A must include measures of health outcomes or of behaviors or other factors that are well-established determinants of health. We are most interested in population health effects, while also differentiating outcomes among subgroups within the population, so that possible unintended consequences of interventions for disadvantaged groups are not masked by population mean effects.

E4A proposals should be designed to answer a clearly articulated, testable research question. A variety of research designs and methods may be suitable to address such questions, including experimental and quasi-experimental designs in which adequate control or comparison groups can be identified or established. Mixed methods may be appropriate to help explain mechanisms or provide context for findings. In limited cases, purely qualitative approaches may be considered for funding. E4A is particularly interested in building evidence on interventions that have immediate relevance in current social, policy, or cultural contexts, and as a rolling submission program can rapidly respond to time-sensitive funding requests. We encourage studies that take advantage of natural experiments, which involve changes in large-scale programs, policies, or practices and can sometimes provide unique opportunities to establish causation. We are also willing to consider research conducted outside the United States that demonstrates clear relevance or applicability to building a Culture of Health in the United States. Applicant organizations must be based in the United States or its territories, however; submissions from teams that include both U.S. and international members are eligible, but the lead applicant must be based in the United States.

As a research funding program, E4A does not fund the costs of program implementation or operations. Also, in line with E4A's focus on evaluating interventions, we do not fund descriptive or exploratory science, literature reviews, needs assessments, or validation of screening tools.
Below we describe general areas of interest that align with the Culture of Health Action Framework's four Action Areas, which guide E4A's funding strategy:
  Making Health a Shared Value (Action Area 1). We are interested in the extent to which social norms and values can be changed through interventions to result in better health, well-being, and equity outcomes. RWJF's vision of health as a shared value reflects the importance of establishing a population health mindset;
strengthening people's connectedness to their communities in ways that spur collective action; and civic engagement to bring about changes to society that enable populations to thrive. While we typically require that research projects examine health as a primary outcome, consideration will be given to projects that measure changes in these ""drivers"" of shared values as primary outcomes with health measures as secondary outcomes.
To learn more about the type of research that is most relevant to Making Health a Shared Value, visit www.evidenceforaction.org/mhsv.
  Fostering Cross-Sector Collaboration (Action Area 2). There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of partnerships to improve population health, and specifically on the role that collaboration plays in achieving positive and sustainable outcomes. Empirical studies on the impacts on health outcomes resulting from collaboration across sectors could be used to inform the establishment of future networks and partnerships that address community health challenges.
  Creating Healthier, More Equitable Communities (Action Area 3). We have limited knowledge about how community-level programs and policies impact population health and equity. Research across multiple settings is needed to determine the characteristics of programs or policies that yield the greatest health impacts, and whether health benefits offset the cost of investments.
  Strengthening Integration of Health Services and Systems (Action Area 4). We need evidence on how health care systems can effectively work with nonhealth care systems or organizations, such as those providing supportive housing, healthy food access, or early childhood education. Few studies have rigorously connected strategies for integrating health care and nonhealth care organizations to individual and community health outcomes, or evaluated their return on investment.
In addition to aligning with one or more of the Action Areas, we are generally interested in research that will help inform efforts to:
  Improve health outcomes and reduce inequities. We support research that will provide evidence of what works to improve outcomes and reduce inequities, rather than research that only describes the existence or magnitude of inequities. E4A proposals should consider the equity implications of the proposed research and, when appropriate, be able to disaggregate effects among subgroups to determine if there are distinct benefits or costs for vulnerable populations.
  Establish generalizable best practices. More evidence is needed on how programs and policies can be structured to maximize returns. For example, are global or targeted interventions more effective, and what are the relative advantages to directing policies at a whole population versus individuals or subgroups at greatest risk? Are there certain life stages during which investments produce disproportionately large long-term benefits?
Findings that can be applied in a variety of policy and program contexts would be especially informative.
  Develop and validate key measures. Although our primary focus is on testing the impact of programs and policies on population health, well-being, and equity, a small portfolio of grants is dedicated to the development and validation of new measures and metrics of population health needed to capture the broader view of physical and mental health, well-being, and equity throughout the life course.

Hazard Mitigation Grant Program - Planning Subapplication,"Mitigation is the effort to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters. Mitigation is taking action now, before the next disaster, to reduce human and financial consequences later. Effective mitigation requires that we all understand local risks, address the hard choices and invest in long-term community well-being and resilience. Without mitigation actions, we jeopardize our safety, financial security, and self-reliance.

As the result of a Presidential Disaster Declaration, FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) funds plans and projects that reduce the effects of future natural disasters. In California, these funds are administered by the Cal OES HMGP Unit. Eligible subapplicants include state agencies, local governments, special districts, and some private non-profits. To learn more about the HMGP, visit: FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance Guidance and the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance Guidance Addendum.

Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA), and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) are additional programs that provide funding for mitigation activities. For additional information on PDM, FMA, and BRIC, click on the following web address: BRIC and FMA.

Hazard Mitigation Grant Program 
HMGP is authorized by Section 404 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170c. The key purpose of HMGP is to ensure that the opportunity to take critical mitigation measures to reduce the risk of loss of life and property from future disasters is not lost during the reconstruction process following a disaster.

HMGP funding is available, when authorized under a Presidential major disaster declaration, in the areas of the State requested by the Governor. Federally-recognized tribes may also submit a request for a Presidential major disaster declaration within their impacted areas (see http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/85146). The amount of HMGP funding available to the Applicant is based on the estimated total Federal assistance, subject to the sliding scale formula outlined in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 206.432(b) that FEMA provides for disaster recovery under Presidential major disaster declarations. The formula provides for up to 15 percent of the first $2 billion of estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance, up to 10 percent for amounts between $2 billion and $10 billion, and up to 7.5 percent for amounts between $10 billion and $35.333 billion. For States with enhanced plans, the eligible assistance is up to 20 percent for estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance not to exceed $35.333 billion.

The Period of Performance (POP) for HMGP begins with the opening of the application period and ends no later than 36 months from the close of the application period.

For additional HMGP Guidance, see Part VIII, A.",,https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1424983165449-38f5dfc69c0bd4ea8a161e8bb7b79553/HMA_Guidance_022715_508.pdf,0
Charles and Mildred Schnurmacher Foundation Grant,"Since 1977, The Charles and Mildred Schnurmacher Foundation has focused on charitable giving. Because we value the importance of enhancing and improving the lives of others, the Foundation supports diverse programs in the fields of human services, education, Jewish causes, health, performing arts, scientific research and animal advocacy.

We review every request submitted and make our decision after diligent and thoughtful consideration. Most grants awarded are for program development or specific project support as opposed to general operating expenses.

Program funding is done mainly in the New York and southern California areas. We do not make grants or loans to individuals. As philanthropists, we recognize that it is not possible to fund every project.",,https://www.charlesandmildred.org/grant-application-process/,1

- Science Education

The Foundation is committed to raising the value of science literacy on a national and local level. The areas given priority consideration within science education are:

+ Teacher quality and professional development in math and science: Comprehensive programs that enhance the quality of math and science teachers entering the classroom, and support teachers with meaningful professional-development opportunities that have a positive impact on student achievement

Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation Grant - International Human Rights,"Established in 1957 and animated by the Jewish value of tzedakah (obligation to be charitable), the Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation promotes social justice and human rights through six program areas:

Strengthening Public Education seeks to improve outcomes and opportunities for students and the quality of teaching and leadership in the Baltimore City school system
Arts and Culture nurtures a robust cultural scene and ensures that the arts are accessible to children and underserved audiences in the Baltimore region
Health and Mental Health aims to expand access to quality, affordable health and mental health services for low-income residents of Baltimore City and create better health outcomes locally, regionally and nationally by addressing environmental threats to human health
Strengthening Israeli Democracy works to support Israel as a pluralistic society by promoting shared society between Jewish and Arab citizens in the Negev, building the pipeline to higher education and workforce integration for Israel's ethnic minorities, and protecting Israel's environment
Jewish Life focuses on keeping Judaism meaningful and responsive to contemporary concerns through ""repairing the world"", furthering progressive and inclusive approaches to Judaism, and facilitating nuanced discourse among American Jews about Israel
International Human Rights advances women's and reproductive rights, and protects the rights of refugees and asylum seekers in the US and other countries
The Foundation supports organizations that: promote systemic change; involve constituent participation in identifying needs, planning and decision-making; encourage innovation; have clear goals, a process for evaluation and a long-range funding strategy.

International Human Rights

The Foundation's program in International Human Rights reflects the commitment of its founders to the principles of universal rights. As President of the American Jewish Committee from 1949 to 1954, Jacob Blaustein worked to protect the civil and religious rights of Jews and other minorities and to promote intergroup tolerance. He was a lifelong advocate for human rights and helped to promote the idea of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, a position that was established more than twenty years after his death in 1970.

The Foundation funds a small number of grantees that work to advance international human rights. The Foundation generally supports US based organizations that address international issues, rather than those based abroad. The Foundation rarely provides support for programs or projects that focus on one country or region.

Internationally, the Foundation works in three areas:

Advancing women's and reproductive rights. We do not provide support for domestic programs in this area.
Protecting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers who seek refuge in the United States and other countries.
Supporting cross-cutting programs that advance leadership development, capacity-building and training across issues. The Foundation does not accept unsolicited proposals in this area.
In 1971, the Foundation created and endowed the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights at the American Jewish Committee. This is an independent entity with its own governance, programmatic priorities and grantmaking program.",,https://blaufund.org/proposal-guidelines/,1
Deloitte Foundation Grant,"Stamford, Conn., August 18, 2020 - The Deloitte Foundation has donated a total of $600,000 to nonprofit organizations in eight original COVID-19 hot spot locations across the country. The intent is to assist those from underrepresented backgrounds and under-resourced communities, primarily students of color, to persist on pathways to college and career success. The Foundation, whose mission is to help develop future talent through a variety of education initiatives, made these COVID-19 grants in response to the extraordinary disruption to student learning due to the pandemic and related economic fallout.

The grants are providing a variety of benefits, including college scholarships for graduating seniors; enhanced online content to accommodate virtual programming; broadband access for virtual online learning programs and internships; technology and technical support to help close the digital divide. In addition, the grants help fuel educator training to aid students who have experienced loss and adversity during the pandemic in building resilience as well as strategies to cope through new life circumstances.

Students in vulnerable communities may struggle to continue their educational journeys through high school and to college due to a myriad of challenges they face in these turbulent times, such as lack of access to hardware, limited broadband connectivity and financial instability due to job losses in their households. Nonprofit organizations that work to empower these students to stay on track with their educational goals during this pandemic must adapt to continue serving students. This can include pivoting to virtual offerings and acquiring new technology platforms, training educators to work in a virtual environment and developing additional resources to help the students continue to thrive.

""Deloitte Foundation's steadfast commitment to supporting education matters even more given COVID-19 and the resulting disproportionate economic impact it has had on vulnerable students,"" remarked Tonie Leatherberry, president, Deloitte Foundation, and principal, Deloitte & Touche LLP . ""This support for diverse learners to participate and persist on pathways from high school to college and careers is particularly important to help mitigate the potential for existing inequalities to intensify in the long-term and develop a more equitable future workforce.""

The Foundation worked with leadership in eight key locations to identify and offer one-time grants to nonprofit organizations that support educational needs of underrepresented, under-resourced high school students with the potential to deliver significant reach with tangible, measurable results. Eighteen nonprofit organizations in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Northern/Central New Jersey, Philadelphia and South Florida received funds:

ECMC Foundation Grant,"Demand for funding has increased dramatically in the last several weeks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on postsecondary institutions and the students they serve.  As a result, we are giving priority to those requests that address the immediate challenges and opportunities arising from the pandemic. We are especially interested in those proposals that focus on implementing systemic reforms to increase college success and career readiness for students from underserved backgrounds.

Based in Los Angeles, ECMC Foundation is a national foundation working to improve postsecondary outcomes for students from underserved backgrounds. It is one of several affiliates under the ECMC Group enterprise based in Minneapolis, which together work to help students succeed.
The Foundation makes investments in two focus areas: College Success and Career Readiness;
and uses a spectrum of funding structures, including strategic grantmaking and program-
related investments, to fund both nonprofit and for-profit ventures. The funding information on this page is for traditional grants in the Foundation's two focus areas.

FOCUS AREAS
  College Success - The College Success focus area aims to increase the number of students from historically and presently underserved backgrounds who persist through and graduate from an institution of higher education with a bachelor's degree.
Understanding that many of our students begin their postsecondary pathways at community colleges, we actively engage in opportunities to invest in transfer success.
College Success invests in postsecondary programs and initiatives that:
o Improve and scale systemic reforms and supports to increase student success at postsecondary institutions.
o Increase currently enrolled students' persistence toward a degree.
o Support on-time transfer from two-year to four-year institutions.
o Enhance students' pathways to graduation with career-ready skills.
o Elevate new research findings and publications that promote student success outcomes.
  Career Readiness - The Career Readiness focus area is committed to improving postsecondary career and technical education (CTE) outcomes for students from underserved backgrounds. Grants made as part of the Career Readiness focus area typically fund intermediaries supporting, institutions and organizations implementing, or third parties researching or evaluating credit-bearing postsecondary pathways for adult learners that lead to credentials and provide a pathway to careers paying family-
sustaining wages. Career Readiness supports projects, programs and initiatives that aim to:
o Build the capacity of institutions and organizations to provide accredited, credit-bearing, industry-informed and transferable postsecondary CTE pathways.
o Conduct research and evaluations to inform the field and promote postsecondary CTE programs that are part of educational pathways that lead to portable certificates or degrees.
o Support adult learners' postsecondary CTE advancement toward a certificate or associate degree with the inclusion of learner-centered approaches and academic and non-academic wraparound supports.

The MAYDAY Fund,"The MAYDAY Fund was established in 1992 to further Shirley Steinman Katzenbach's commitment to social and medical causes. The Trustees decided to adopt Mrs. Katzenbach's special interest in the treatment of pain as the Fund's mission. The name MAYDAY commemorates the date of her birth and is the international word signaling a cry for help, taken from the French ""m'aidez"" or ""help me.""

MAYDAY chose its original agenda with the understanding that creating meaningful change with modest funding is a formidable challenge. Acting on advice that ""it is better to be a rifle than a shotgun,"" the Trustees set their sights on the alleviation of human physical pain. They were aware that excellent research had already led to a wealth of information about the treatment of pain, but that existing knowledge was not effectively used. As a first step, they decided to concentrate on closing this gap.

The MAYDAY Fund, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization since 1992, engages only in philanthropic grant activities defined by its mission targeting the alleviation of pain. It should not be confused with any other organization that uses a similar name or includes ""mayday"" in its representation.

What We Fund

The MAYDAY Fund has thematic grant-making targets, which evolve and change over time. MAYDAY has funded single-year projects as well as multi-year grants. Projects span the spectrum from bench science to education to professional practice. They address the role of patients, as well as that of professionals, rights, as well as responsibilities, and often crosscut our grant-making targets.

Recognizing the diverse nature of pain throughout all stages of life, MAYDAY supports projects affecting groups from infancy to old age. Historically, pain in non-verbal populations has also been specifically targeted and the Trustees remain cognizant of the challenges presented by this population across all project categories.

Many of the Fund's grants support interdisciplinary professional collaboration. We support projects intended to augment evidence that pain is diagnosable and treatable. Our grantees are expected to be able to provide credible evidence of measurable impact as a result of our funding.",,http://www.maydayfund.org/apply-for-a-grant/,0

William K. Warren Foundation Grant,"To seek funding from The William K. Warren Foundation, please read the guidelines carefully. Our guidelines have been established to help us in the decision-making process.  Due to the great volume of grant requests we receive, we are unable to review requests that do not conform to these guidelines.

GENERAL GUIDELINES
The Foundation follows general guidelines to assure proper and equitable use of the Foundation's funds.  These guidelines are in keeping with its policies and purposes and assure that allocation of such funds is made within the limits of its financial resources while also keeping in mind the wishes of its founders that the Foundation would be ""evergreen"" as opposed to seeking to disperse all of its funds as soon as possible.

Support for certain programs is not to be interpreted as a judgment of the merits of those that do not receive funds.  Rather, it is a reflection of the Foundation's belief that adherence to its guidelines, which are regularly reviewed, leads to the most effective use of its limited resources.

The Foundation is sensitive to changes in community issues and attitudes.  Within the limits of its resources, the Foundation addresses the needs that arise from the emergence of new and different social issues to maintain a balance between innovation and maintenance of ongoing programs.

This statement of policy sets forth the current views of The William K. Warren Foundation with respect to the best use of its assets.  It may be revoked or amended in any respect for any reason, and there can be no assurance that it necessarily represents future policies or activities of the Foundation.",,https://www.williamkwarrenfoundation.org/request-a-grant/,1
Pathways to the Liberal Arts,"The Pathways to the Liberal Arts initiative supports access to and success in liberal arts education, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds who might not ordinarily attempt a rigorous liberal arts program. Grants of varying amounts, ranging from $100,000-$400,000 over a 24-36 month period, will be made to each funded project participating in this initiative. The size of the grant will be based on the number of institutions involved and the scope of the project. We expect this grant program will remain open for approximately three to five years.
Rationale Students who historically have been excluded from higher education-including low-income students, first-generation students, and students of color-now constitute the ""new majority"" of undergraduates.
Many of these students contend with difficult family circumstances, economic challenges, and fragile self-confidence during their college years, and many institutions that serve them struggle to keep them engaged and on the path to the associate or baccalaureate degree. While there have been significant advances in academic advising, data analytics, and the use of technology to improve the experience of at-risk students and their likelihood of graduation, interventions in the curriculum itself have been relatively sparse.
Students are often stymied by confusing and fragmented college curricula that interfere with graduating on time, if at all. Worse, a ""cafeteria"" approach to curriculum, in which courses may have little apparent connection to each other, and requirements may seem arbitrary, can undermine the purposes of a college education: to help students cultivate the knowledge, skills and capacity for leading considered lives, to enable and encourage them to participate effectively in our democracy, and to pursue fulfillment in their professional and personal lives. These lifelong benefits of a liberal arts education are increasingly seen as luxuries, out of reach for all except the privileged few.
Research shows that ""new majority"" students benefit immensely from taking rigorous, engaging, and coherent coursework, with requirements for graduation clearly mapped out semester to semester.
Intentional curriculum design can make a college education more intellectually cohesive for students while strengthening retention and graduation, reducing institutional costs, and sharpening the college culture of teaching and learning. Such curricular ""pathways"" also enable two- and four-year institutions to differentiate themselves with distinctive academic programming in a crowded marketplace.
Goals The Pathways to the Liberal Arts initiative supports institutions in implementing significant curricular reforms that deepen student learning in the liberal arts and keep them on the path to the degree.  The initiative is focused on advancing the three streams of work described below. Institutions are encouraged to choose one of the three areas of emphasis.

I. Strengthening access to the liberal arts in the transition from high school to college. From the Teagle Foundation's long running College-Community Connections program, we have learned that high school students from underserved backgrounds benefit from the opportunity to take college-level coursework led by college faculty, which gives them firsthand exposure to the expectations of the college classroom and helps to cultivate their understanding that liberal arts education can be exciting and enlarging.
The Pathways to the Liberal Arts initiative supports four-year institutions in developing rigorous preparatory programs aimed at underserved high school students in their local community. We are especially interested in creative approaches to introducing high school students to classic texts-including, but certainly not limited to, literature, history, philosophy, and political science-that they are otherwise unlikely to encounter in order to sharpen their critical reading and writing skills, broaden their perspective, and help them see what they are capable of achieving through sustained engagement with challenging and inspiring works. The preparatory programs may vary in duration, and while we encourage a residential component, we recognize that not all institutions are in a position to offer residency on campus

II. Strengthening transfer access to the liberal arts from two- to four-year colleges.
Community colleges now enroll almost half of all undergraduates nationally, most of whom aspire to transfer to four-year baccalaureate-granting institutions. Policymakers have understandably focused on making provisions for transfer between two- and four-year institutions in the public sector. However, strengthening transfer pathways between public two-year colleges and private four-year liberal arts colleges remains an overlooked mechanism for enhancing access to the baccalaureate.
The Pathways to the Liberal Arts initiative supports academic partnerships between public two-year and private four-year colleges to facilitate transfer and completion of the baccalaureate in the liberal arts. Curricular bridge-building between public two-year colleges and private four-year colleges provides transfer students with more options to complete their education in a timely fashion. Small independent colleges in particular are especially well-suited to serve transfer students by providing personal attention to help them reach their goals. At the same time, community college students bring important benefits to private colleges in the form of diversity of background and lived experience, enhancing the educational environment for all students.

III. Strengthening the rigor and quality of liberal arts pathways at two- and four-year colleges. Many institutions are reconsidering how to attract students to the liberal arts and how to help those in the liberal arts have a richer educational experience. One challenge common to both two- and four-year college settings is proliferating course offerings that overwhelm and confuse students and make a college education seem like a box-checking exercise rather than a cohesive and comprehensive intellectual endeavor.
The Pathways to the Liberal Arts initiative supports clearly defined, structured, and efficient curricular pathways in the liberal arts at two- and four-year institutions. We encourage faculty to think through not just their responsibility for individual courses but how to help students see the connections among multiple courses as they move through their programs of study. We prioritize curricular redesign efforts that will reach a significant proportion, if not all, of the undergraduate student body. Some examples are offered below:
  Creating common intellectual experiences where students take a series of linked courses to strengthen foundational skills, engage with enduring questions and major writers and thinkers, and build a sense of belonging to an intellectual community. Such common intellectual experiences may be built into lower division coursework or in upper division coursework for the major.
  Embedding academically enriching activities such as undergraduate research and project-based learning in the curriculum, with the appropriate preparatory coursework, so students are positioned to complete high-quality capstone projects and share their work with their peers at research colloquia and similar gatherings.
  For institutions where a significant proportion of the student body needs developmental education, reforming non-credit remedial course sequences-
which often prevent students from taking credit-bearing coursework in the liberal arts-so they are shortened, and in some cases, eliminated.",,http://www.teaglefoundation.org/Teagle/media/GlobalMediaLibrary/documents/rfps/Pathways-to-the-Liberal-Arts-_-Fall-2019.pdf?ext=.pdf,0
Education for American Civic Life,"This initiative supports efforts to prepare students to become informed and engaged participants in the civic life of their local and national communities. Grants of varying amounts, ranging from $100,000-
$400,000 over a 24-36 month period, will be made to each funded project participating in this initiative.
The size of the grant will be based on the scope of the project. We expect this grant program will remain open for approximately three to five years.
Goals The mission of the Teagle Foundation is ""to support and strengthen liberal arts education, which we see as fundamental to meaningful work, effective citizenship, and a fulfilling life."" Civic education entails an understanding of American history and democratic principles.  When viewed expansively, this knowledge can guide students to recognize elements of community formation and push them to consider their responsibilities beyond themselves. It lays the groundwork for how members of a shared community appreciate and grapple with their differences and guides them toward a collective civil life.
Colleges and universities often assume that their incoming students have received prior preparation on topics such as the formation of the American republic or the crafting of the Constitution. In doing so, they miss opportunities to help undergraduates develop a mature understanding of the history and fragility of democracy. We encourage institutions to build on these themes across their curriculum and to invite deeper academic inquiry on critical issues that vex our local and national communities.
Through ""Education for American Civic Life,"" the Foundation seeks to elevate the civic objectives of liberal arts education by partnering with institutions offering bold and coherent initiatives that endow students with the content, skills, and sensibility to participate in a political system designed for self-
governance. While progress has been made at many institutions of higher education to promote civic action as part of the undergraduate experience, the Foundation is especially concerned with grounding such action in comprehensive civic education through the curriculum.
Criteria for Project Proposals The Teagle Foundation welcomes the participation of a diverse array of institutions-community colleges, liberal arts colleges, comprehensive and research universities-in this initiative. Grants of varying amounts, ranging from $100,000-$400,000 over a 24-36-month period, will be made to each funded project participating in this initiative. Requests from both single institutions and multiple institutions partnering together will be considered. The size of the grant will be based on the scope of the project. Planning grants in the range of $25,000 over 6-12 months will also be considered.
Through this initiative, the Foundation seeks ambitious projects that confront gaps in undergraduates'
civic knowledge and prepares them for the intellectual demands of democratic participation.
Successful proposals will seek to promote learning about the formation of the American republic, the crafting of its Constitution, the history of contention over the interpretation of the Constitution, the development of representative political structures, and the principles of democracy. Civic education is strongest when it is not treated as a subject in isolation but becomes part of the student experience across disciplines. For example, the study of history and literature can help students recognize recurring themes and problems in American life such as the tension between individual rights and national security, or the challenges and opportunities faced by immigrants.
We give priority to proposals designed to reach a significant proportion, if not all, of the undergraduate student body and that infuse civic education across the curriculum. While innovative pedagogies that advance civic engagement are acknowledged and appreciated (e.g., service-learning, public sphere pedagogy), please note our chief interest is in content, i.e., what students will learn. There are a variety of curricular approaches to and considerations for addressing this objective. Some examples are offered below.",,http://www.teaglefoundation.org/Teagle/media/GlobalMediaLibrary/documents/rfps/Civic-Education-RFP_Fall-2020.pdf?ext=.pdf,0

Cyberinfrastructure for Biological Research (CIBR),"Funding Opportunity Number: PD 18-1165

Biological processes at all scales from molecules to ecosystems are determined through the encoding, exchange, and interpretation of information.Advances in the biological sciences are enabled by our capacity to acquire, manage, represent, and analyze biological information through the use of modern instrumentation and computational tools.Developing an integrated understanding of cell function, regulatory systems, or ecological responses to environmental change are just a few examples of biological research areas that involve the acquisition, observation, experiment, and modeling of large amounts of data. Proposals are invited that offer potentially transformative outcomes through the development of informatics tools and resources that (1) offer novel and significant advances in the use of biological data and/or (2) will enable and stimulate advances through their impact on a significant segment of the biological research community supported by the NSF BIO Directorate.
Awards in CIBR should produce, or substantially expand a finished product that will have demonstrable impact in advancing biological research. Proposals should convey their likelihood of success through greater attention to user engagement, design quality, engineering practices, management plan, and dissemination. Budgets and award durations should accommodate the iterative process of bringing a proof of concept into a robust, broadly-adopted cyberinfrastructure. Development proposals are more outcome-driven than Innovation awards and are typically assessed on their perceived contribution to a broad portfolio of cyberinfrastructure resources. Synergies with, and leveraging of, other existing and ongoing resources are taken into consideration.
CIBR supports development in areas that may include (but are not limited to):
- Databases consisting of primary data obtained through observation, experimentation, modelling, or synthesis of existing data into new derivative products.
- New tools for the construction, operation, and utilization of biological databases, including database architectures and infrastructures, data standards designed to be extendable to different biological domains, and data structures for new types of biological information
- Software or ontologies related to the retrieval, integration, and use of heterogeneous biological information, for example, data discovery, data-mining, data integration or visualization
- Tools that facilitate biological research workflows, analytic pathways, or integration between the field and the laboratory, or between observation, experiments and models
- Software and methods for making use of new technologies for the acquisition, communication or visualization of biological data
- Infrastructure that provides broad community access to shared computational and data resources, commonly referred to as scientific gateways.
Higher priority will be placed on proposals to create computational tools and data resources that are applicable to a broad range of biological research questions and shared by a broad user community.Proposals to develop tools or databases that are limited to a specific research project, laboratory, or institution should be submitted to the relevant BIO programs that would normally support that research.",,https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18594/nsf18594.htm,0

Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Pioneering Ideas Brief Proposals,"Introduction
As our current reality underscores, we live in a dynamic world where unforeseen global events; new technologies; scientific discoveries; changes in our climate, economy, demographics; and more continually shape where and how we live, learn, work and play. These changes will profoundly impact health equity in our society, from our individual health and the health of our families to the health of our communities.

What dramatic changes might we see in the next 5 to 15 years? What can we do today to create a better, more equitable tomorrow?   

We seek to answer these questions, anticipate the future, and support unconventional approaches and breakthrough ideas that can help lead the way to a future where everyone in the United States can live their healthiest life possible.

Purpose
Pioneering Ideas: Exploring the Future to Build a Culture of Health seeks proposals that are primed to influence health equity in the future. We are interested in ideas that address any of these four areas of focus: Future of Evidence; Future of Social Interaction; Future of Food; Future of Work. Additionally, we welcome ideas that might fall outside of these four focus areas, but which offer unique approaches to advancing health equity and our progress toward a Culture of Health.

We want to hear from scientists, anthropologists, artists, urban planners, community leaders anyone, anywhere who has a new or unconventional idea that could alter the trajectory of health, and improve health equity and well-being for generations to come. The changes we seek require diverse perspectives and cannot be accomplished by any one person, organization or sector. 

Please note: While this call for proposals is focused on broader and longer-term societal trends and shifts that were evolving prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we recognize the unique circumstances and learning created by the COVID-19 pandemic may inform your response. It is at your discretion whether you propose a project related to the pandemic directly or indirectly.",,https://anr.rwjf.org/viewCfp.do?cfpId=1500&cfpOverviewId=,1

Strategic Grantmaking,"Based in Los Angeles, ECMC Foundation is a nationally focused foundation whose mission is to inspire and facilitate improvements that affect educational outcomes -- especially among underserved populations--through evidence-based innovation. It is one of several affiliates under the ECMC Group enterprise based in Minneapolis, which together work to help students succeed. The Foundation makes investments in two focus areas: College Success and Career Readiness; and uses a spectrum of funding structures, including strategic grantmaking and program-related investments, to fund both nonprofit and for-profit ventures. Working with its grantees, partners and peers, ECMC Foundation's vision is for all learners to unlock their fullest potential.

As a result of COVID-19: Demand for funding has increased dramatically in the last several weeks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on postsecondary institutions and the students they serve. As a result, they are giving priority to those requests that address the immediate challenges and opportunities arising from the pandemic. The foundation is especially interested in those proposals that focus on implementing systemic reforms to increase college success and career readiness for students from underserved backgrounds.


The funding information on this page is for traditional grants in the Foundation's two focus areas.

College Success--The College Success portfolio is focused on increasing the number of college students from historically underrepresented backgrounds, including low-income and first-generation populations, who pursue and attain bachelor's degrees. This portfolio considers programs and initiatives that work with currently enrolled college students to promote two-year transfer and bachelor degree completion. The sponsor seeks innovative programs in both direct service models as well as overarching systemic reform initiatives.

Career Readiness--The Career Readiness portfolio is committed to connecting adults with limited or no education beyond high school to career pathways that allow for economic mobility and a family-sustaining wage. This portfolio considers high-quality, industry-informed postsecondary education programs up to the associate level as the primary mechanism to meet its goals. Funding builds the capacity of institutions providing or supporting career and technical education; contributes research to improve the field and promote support for career readiness programs; and develops scalable postsecondary program models that incorporate wraparound services, implement a student-centered educational approach, and offer accredited, industry-informed career pathways.",,http://www.ecmcfoundation.org/get-involved/how-to-apply,0

Priority is given to grants to congregations and other related Unitarian Universalist organizations who are responding to the crisis with systemic, collaborative approaches, such as partnering with local organizations to provide assistance in the congregation's local community to people who are at significant risk to health and livelihood because of COVID-19. Grants should not be given, at this time, to assist congregations and other UU related institutions due to reduction in sources of income (such as reductions in pledging, rental income, etc.) Grants should not be given, at this time, to assist congregations and other UU related institutions with unplanned costs due to COVID-19 (such as maintenance, cleaning, or technology issues).

Priority is given to immediate and intermediate disaster relief needs such as building repairs, food, water, shelter, sanitation, health care, and needs related to return to school and work.

II. Application Process

The Illinois office currently manages a number of separate discretionary foundations, each with its own mission statement and funding parameters. The first step in our streamlined application process is to select a foundation toward which to apply. This step requires you to determine if there is a match between your organization's work and the funding parameters of the selected foundation.

Before You Apply
We recommend that you thoroughly research the information provided at www.bankofamerica.com/grantmaking. The website provides detailed information about each foundation, and the Find a Foundation search feature may assist you further in selecting the various foundations. Specifically, we recommend that you thoroughly read the foundation detail pages, which are 1-page summaries on each foundation, and the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) tab which provides helpful overview information.
After exploring our website, you should be able to determine:
1. An appropriate foundation by entering the Area Served and/or Program Type preference(s) in the search filter.
2. If your organization in fact meets the geographic and/or programmatic parameters of the specific foundation. Please refer to Section IV for brief details about the geographic focus area(s) and proposal due dates of each foundation.
3. The proposal deadline of the specific foundation, ensuring that your complete proposal is submitted at the appropriate time of the year.

Bullitt Foundation - Deep Green Buildings,"Using the Bullitt Center as a touchstone, the Deep Green Buildings program promotes huge leaps-as opposed to incremental shifts-in the built environment. It promotes the construction of commercial and residential buildings that implement designs, materials, and technologies that are most relevant to 21st century needs and conditions, including the impending changes to our region's climate. Deep Green Buildings emphasizes actual building performance instead of installed measures or attribute checklists. It encourages the development of structures with very long design lives and inherent flexibility to adjust to an uncertain future. It seeks to create broad industry and consumer acceptance of buildings that operate as components in a larger, ecologically resilient and sustainable neighborhood system; are comfortable, productive, healthy, and beautiful; and display the lightest possible environmental footprint. Ultimately, the program works to ensure that the Bullitt Center is the first of many buildings of its kind.",,http://www.bullitt.org/grants/grantmaking-process/,0
Bullitt Foundation - Regional Ecosystem Health Program,"The Regional Ecosystem Health program recognizes that human well-being is dependent on the ecosystem goods and services that nature provides. It addresses issues at the interface of the built environment and the natural world and illuminates the links between healthy ecosystems, open space, working lands, and vibrant human communities. It seeks to advance innovations in regional planning and management of land and water to improve cross-sector coordination and ensure that policy and financial decisions fully account for the value we receive from nature. And, it supports efforts, based on sound science, to restore and protect nature as the basic infrastructure supporting urban resilience and sustainability.

Ecosystem goods and services include more than the raw materials on which our economies and communities are built. They also include the fundamental life support services provided ""for free"" by nature: purification of air, regulation of water flows, detoxification and decomposition of wastes, regeneration of soil fertility, pollination of food crops, and production and maintenance of biodiversity.

The Regional Ecosystem Health program recognizes that reciprocal financial agreements, market mechanisms, taxes, fees, subsidies, and public education can complement regulation as policy tools. It acknowledges climate change as a major additional stress on ecosystems, and it overlaps substantially and intentionally with the Foundation's other programs.
Major areas of program engagement include applied urban research and tool development, conservation finance and environmental economics, and ecosystem defense and ecological restoration.",,http://www.bullitt.org/grants/grantmaking-process/,0

Mathile Family Foundation Grant,"COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION

Many of Daytons young students are motivated to learn and succeed. However, a growing number lack access to educational opportunities that will help them to fulfill their potential.
At the Mathile Family Foundation, we believe that the greatest social and economic equalizer is education. So, the support of quality educational opportunities for our areas at-risk children has grown even more important for more than 25 years of service. With this in mind, the Mathile Family Foundation has established a goal to increase the number of low-income post-secondary graduates from our most-vulnerable neighborhoods. Naturally, providing tuition assistance and scholarships to increase college access and success is an integral part of our strategic equation.

Throughout our history, The Foundations support of PreK  12 education has had a focus on Catholic schools in the Dayton area. In addition to high academic expectations, we believe Catholic schools develop the solid moral and community values that prepare students to be lifelong models of strong character and compassion.

Our support of these important institutions touches many different aspects of the school community and includes an evidence based student support program called City Connects which was developed by Boston College; a leadership program for Catholic school administrators focused on professional management; and an elementary-high school alliance which not only strengthens the schools  but addresses many of the challenges students face transitioning into high school.",,https://mathilefamilyfoundation.org/guidelines/,1
The Tuscarawas County Community Foundation Grant,"The Tuscarawas County Community Foundation, Inc. was established in 2001 as a tax-exempt community foundation.

The Foundation welcomes grant applications from non-profit organizations serving the residents of Tuscarawas County.

The Foundation administers a general fund, which is made up of unrestricted donations to the Foundation. The unrestricted nature of those gifts allows the Foundation flexibility in its charitable purpose and empowers the Board of Directors with the ability to respond to innovative projects and changing community needs over a wide variety of fields. The Board of Directors of the Foundation awards grants to qualified charitable organizations who serve the residents of Tuscarawas County. The frequency of awarding grants and amounts is within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

The Foundations charitable grant making includes both capital and program grants which are awarded in the following categories: Arts, Culture, & Humanities; Civic & Community Affairs; Conservation & Environment; Education; Health & Wellness; and Human Services.",,http://tuscfoundation.com/grants/#proposals,0
Collaborative Research Grants - Convening Grant,"Funding Opportunity Number: 20191205-RZ

The Collaborative Research program aims to advance humanistic knowledge through collaboration between two or more scholars. The program encourages projects that propose diverse approaches to topics, incorporates multiple points of view, and explores new avenues of inquiry in the humanities that lead to print and digital grant products for scholars and general audiences.
The program allows projects that propose research in a single field of study, as well as interdisciplinary work. Projects that include partnerships with researchers from the natural and social sciences are encouraged, but they must remain firmly rooted in the humanities and must employ humanistic methods. Partnerships among different types of institutions are welcome.
For example, research universities might partner with teaching colleges, libraries, museums, or independent research institutions.
Collaborating scholars may be drawn from a single institution or several institutions across the United States. Participants may be based outside the United States, but at least half of each type of participant (such as directors, collaborators, participants, technical assistants, and student assistants) must be U.S. citizens.
Applicant organizations should propose tangible and sustainable outcomes such as co-authored or multi-authored books; born-digital publications; themed issues of peer-reviewed journals; a series of peer-reviewed articles in academic journals or articles in general audience publications or both; and open-access digital resources. All project outcomes must be based on and must convey interpretive humanities research. Recipients are expected to disseminate the results of their work.
Funding is available for sustained full-time or part-time activities conducted by the collaborating scholars during the period of performance. Allowable costs include but are not limited to, salary replacement; compensation of collaborators, consultants, and research assistants; fringe benefits; and travel, lodging, and per diem costs.
NEH encourages Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Colleges and Universities to apply for Collaborative Research grants.

Convening Grants 
Convening Grants fund conferences, workshops, seminars, and working group meetings that gather participants in person to sharpen the chosen research topic and plan subsequent print or digital publications, such as edited volumes, co-authored books, peer-reviewed articles, and open-access digital resources. Conferences are understood to be open to the public or to members of an intellectual community that is broader than the invited attendees.
Convening Grants may be used to plan and prepare for a Publication Grant in a subsequent year; however, the preparation of an application for a NEH Publication Grant or any other grant may not be a grant product. Primary grant products for Convening Grants may include live or recorded video of the convening, web-posted papers, papers in preparation for subsequent peerreviewed articles, podcasts, blogs, and discussion boards.
Convening Grants are for up to $50,000 with a period of performance of one year.",,https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/collaborative-research-nofo-fy19.pdf,0
Collaborative Research Grants - Publication Grants,"Funding Opportunity Number: 20191205-RZ

Program Description
 The Collaborative Research program aims to advance humanistic knowledge through collaboration between two or more scholars. The program encourages projects that propose diverse approaches to topics, incorporates multiple points of view, and explores new avenues of inquiry in the humanities that lead to print and digital grant products for scholars and general audiences.
The program allows projects that propose research in a single field of study, as well as interdisciplinary work. Projects that include partnerships with researchers from the natural and social sciences are encouraged, but they must remain firmly rooted in the humanities and must employ humanistic methods. Partnerships among different types of institutions are welcome.
For example, research universities might partner with teaching colleges, libraries, museums, or independent research institutions.
Collaborating scholars may be drawn from a single institution or several institutions across the United States. Participants may be based outside the United States, but at least half of each type of participant (such as directors, collaborators, participants, technical assistants, and student assistants) must be U.S. citizens.
Applicant organizations should propose tangible and sustainable outcomes such as co-authored or multi-authored books; born-digital publications; themed issues of peer-reviewed journals; a series of peer-reviewed articles in academic journals or articles in general audience publications or both; and open-access digital resources. All project outcomes must be based on and must convey interpretive humanities research. Recipients are expected to disseminate the results of their work.
Funding is available for sustained full-time or part-time activities conducted by the collaborating scholars during the period of performance. Allowable costs include but are not limited to, salary replacement; compensation of collaborators, consultants, and research assistants; fringe benefits; and travel, lodging, and per diem costs.
NEH encourages Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Colleges and Universities to apply for Collaborative Research grants.

Publication Grants 
Publication Grants support the completion of print or digital products. Examples of such products include co-authored or multi-authored books; born-digital publications; a series of peer-reviewed articles or articles for general audience publications, themed issues of peerreviewed journals; and open-access digital resources.
Publication Grants are for up to $250,000 with a period of performance of one to three years.
Applicants may not request more than $100,000 per year of the period of performance.
A Convening Grant is not a prerequisite for a Publication Grant. Collaborators who have done their planning and are ready to work toward completion and publication may apply directly for a Publication Grant",,https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/collaborative-research-nofo-fy19.pdf,0

The Glenn Foundation Grant,"Carrie E. and Lena V. Glenn

Carrie E. Glenn
1884 - 1977

""We did without many things that we might have had, but it has given us a lot of satisfaction to know that we could and did take care of ourselves without asking anyone for help. Our sole purpose in making this Foundation was to try to have any money that we might leave go where it is needed most and will do the most good.""
- Carrie and Lena Glenn
March 28, 1973

Lena V. Glenn
1886 - 1984

About The Glenn Foundation
Born in the 1880's, Carrie Eugenia Glenn and Lena Viola Glenn were two of ten children who grew up on a farm in the Crowders Creek section of Gaston County, North Carolina.  The family valued education, hard work, and self-reliance, producing a college professor, a prominent Gastonia surgeon, a prominent Lincolnton businessman, three teachers, a librarian, and a business school graduate who became E. F. Hutton's personal secretary. 

Miss Carrie Glenn received an associate of arts degree from the State Normal and Industrial College for Women [The Normal] in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1906 (today's University of North Carolina at Greensboro), a bachelor's degree in education from George Peabody College of Education at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee in 1916, and a master's degree in education from George Peabody in 1929.  She served as elementary supervisor for Gaston County rural schools for 15 years and retired as a third grade teacher in the Gaston County Schools. 

Miss Lena Glenn received a diploma in pedagogy from The Normal in 1908 and earned a master's of library science degree from what is now Emory University in 1920.  She did not work for many years until she became employed with the Gaston County Public Library, retiring as the first cataloguer. 

The sisters were Presbyterians.  They never married and lived frugally with the goal of being able to care for themselves in their later years.  In 1961, they moved from Gastonia to The Presbyterian Home of High Point, a retirement community in High Point, North Carolina, where they lived until their deaths. 

On August 30, 1971, the sisters established The Carrie E. and Lena V. Glenn Foundation as an indentured trust with an initial contribution of $25,000. At their deaths, their combined estates of almost $2.9 million were added to the trust. On July 1, 2005, the Foundation changed its legal structure from a trust to a nonprofit corporation.  Since 1972, the Glenn Foundation has granted $8.779 million to 255 unduplicated organizations for 975 different programs and services. Foundation assets today are approximately $6.87 million.",,http://www.theglennfoundation.org/apply.html,0
