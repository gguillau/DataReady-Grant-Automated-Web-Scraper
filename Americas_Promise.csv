BJ’s Adopt-A-School Program,"BJ’s Adopt-A-School Program started in 1996 with a single school. Over the years, it has expanded to help schools in 15 states. The program’s mission: giving “adopted” schools support they can use to enhance existing programs and curriculum objectives. It is just another way BJ's care about their Members and the communities that they live in. Now in its 19th year, BJ’s Adopt-A-School program has provided more than $1.8 million in funding to thousands of schools, helping ensure children receive a quality education. Here’s how it works: Public school teachers from across America post project requests at DonorsChoose.org for materials they need like books, art supplies, software, the list is long! Donors are people just like you and companies like us — people interested in supporting education, who search the site and give to the project that inspires them most. When a project reaches its funding goal, the materials are shipped to the school, and donors receive photos of the project and a letter from the teacher. Schools participating in BJ’s Adopt-A-School Giving Program receive a one-time donation to use toward discretionary programs, such as field trip and special events, reading enhancement programs or other educational needs, and a complimentary BJ’s Business Membership, providing access to low-cost, high-quality supplies. Maximum award: varies by project. Eligibility: U.S. public elementary schools. Deadline: Rolling.",Deadline: Rolling,http://www.bjs.com/adopt-a-school.content.about_adopt_school.A.about_community2,0
